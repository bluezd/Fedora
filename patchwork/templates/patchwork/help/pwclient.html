<p><code>pwclient</code> is the command-line client for patchwork. Currently,
it provides access to some read-only features of patchwork, such as downloading
and applying patches.</p>

<p>To use pwclient, you will need:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The <a href="{% url patchwork.views.pwclient %}">pwclient</a>
  program (11kB, python script)</li>
 <li>(optional) a <code>.pwclientrc</code> file in your home directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can create your own <code>.pwclientrc</code> file. Each
<a href="{% url patchwork.views.projects %}">patchwork project</a>
provides a sample linked from the 'project info' page.</p>
