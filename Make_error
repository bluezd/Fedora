The problem is that gcc 4.6 doesn't support anymore linker-style architecture options.  

solution:
In arch/x86/vdso/Makefile :
replace "-m elf_x86_64" by "-m64" on the line starting with  VDSO_LDFLAGS_vdso.lds
replace "-m elf_x86" by "-m32" on the line starting with  VDSO_LDFLAGS_vdso32.lds


reason : Maybe the make tool is so new ......
